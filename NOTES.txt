Overhaul on time:
	- Calculate difference in time between each frame
		-> avg differnce (may not be needed)
	- Create time vector of n points at t spacing
		-> n is number of G' G'' points
		-> t is frame time difference
	- Encorporate new timing into graphs etc.

"skip set" in contrast GUI needs to be fixed
	- doesn't remove the file names from struct, thus tries to 
		contrast and open Masks that don't exist

Time overhaul considered but not implimented.
	- mean time step
	- 0 : mTimStep : (nPoints - 1) * mTimeStep
	
MSD not calculating correctly - nanmean may not be a solution. 
	- still stepping back in MSD
